# Atrocious Algorithms
*A collection of absurd, convoluted, and rather impractical algorithms.*

This repository contains various algorithms that intentionally designed to be awful in nature, implemented in Java. The algorithms take a different and more creative/convoluted approach to solving a "problem" (i.e. recreational parodies) that is traditionally trivial to solve, or is already solved by well-known and efficient means. As a consequence, they may have horrendously intolerable asymptotic time and/or memory complexity (i.e. extremely computationally intensive), and are woefully impractical for production.

**It is not wise to take any algorithms here seriously**; however, their implementations may solve some unique challenges brought on by a convoluted approach.
